### Using percentages & avoiding heights
A look at why fixed unit sizes are a bad idea when it comes to creating layouts, and the times you might want to use them.

This is a general rule. There are times when you want to use height, but for the most part, they cause more issues than they solve.

It's very rare that I ever use height, and we'll see why in this lesson.

## [Day 3](https://courses.kevinpowell.co/courses/conquering-responsive-layouts/254267-day-3-enter-max-width)
### Enter max-width
As we saw, setting a fixed width on an element tends to be a bad idea. Instead we can use percentages, which make our lives easier.

The only issue with this is, at large screens, things can get too big. Thankfully, we have max-width that can help us out!

### Extra-curricular
Today is a catch-up day, so no official lessons.

If you are eager to dive keep learning though, there has been some talk about viewport units in the Discord server.

Below is a video where I take a look at them. A word of warning though, I do look at using them for font-size, and while cool, there are some accessibility issues with doing so, so I wouldn't suggest it unless it's just for a personal project of yours.

This is totally optional, and while they can be useful, they will not be something I'll be diving into in this course. If you do like them and want to practice with them, there is no reason you can't incorporate them into future challenges though!

## [Day 5](https://courses.kevinpowell.co/courses/conquering-responsive-layouts/256691-day-5-practice-time)
### Practice time!
You saw what you want to build in the last video. There are no starting files this time, we're writing everything starting at zero! So open up your favorite code editor, or create a new CodePen and start writing some code.

You can find the Figma design file right here if you want to match it as closely as possible.

Also, please feel free to vary it with different fonts or colors if you'd like!

For some of you, this might be simple. For others, if you feel the need to refer back to other lessons, go for it. But no copying and pasting. Write everything from scratch!

## [Day 6](https://courses.kevinpowell.co/courses/conquering-responsive-layouts/257597-day-6-it-s-the-weekend)
### It's the weekend!

In this first week, we've looked at:

    Using percentages for widths
    Avoiding to set heights
    Using max-width


While there is nothing overly complicated with any of that, being comfortable with these things is the key to mastering responsive layouts.

With a good understanding of the above, all we need is a little flexbox and we're going to start knocking even complex layouts out of the park!

In this section of the course, you can find a few links to some extra reading that you can do if you're looking to continue learning a bit. They'll help supplement what we're covering here, but none of it is required reading ðŸ˜Š.

I'll be sharing my solution to the challenge tomorrow. If you're a little bit behind at this point, you can use today and tomorrow to catch up a little.

Next week, we'll be jumping into flexbox and how we can use it with what we've already learned to make our layouts. We'll be looking at both the macro-scale with a page's layout, as well as the more micro-scale in putting together a common navbar component.

#### A Tale of width and max-width
An interesting look at the two properties, and how they might not always act the way you think they will. 

As it says, the second one is the easier one to understand, just like we looked at, so I plan on sticking with that one ðŸ˜Š

## [Day 8](https://courses.kevinpowell.co/courses/conquering-responsive-layouts/260392-day-8-flexbox-basics)
### Flexbox Basics
Flexbox was the first actual layout property given to us in CSS, which is wild because it was only added relatively recently.

This part of the course isn't a complete overview of flexbox, but more of a look at how we can quickly and easily use it to start making more interesting looking layouts.

We'll be starting with some simple columns set ups, plus a nice trick to space things out. In the coming days, we'll be diving deeper in and making more fleshed out layouts.

Flexbox does do a few strange things, which we'll be exploring as well.

For the challenge, I've provided the design specs as a PDF. I've also provided the starting files both in as a download to work locally on your computer, as well as a Codepen. Pick whichever you'd prefer
