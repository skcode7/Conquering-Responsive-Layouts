## [Day 1](https://courses.kevinpowell.co/courses/conquering-responsive-layouts/233004-using-percentages-avoiding-heights)
### Using percentages & avoiding heights
A look at why fixed unit sizes are a bad idea when it comes to creating layouts, and the times you might want to use them.

This is a general rule. There are times when you want to use height, but for the most part, they cause more issues than they solve.

It's very rare that I ever use height, and we'll see why in this lesson.

## [Day 3](https://courses.kevinpowell.co/courses/conquering-responsive-layouts/254267-day-3-enter-max-width)
### Enter max-width
As we saw, setting a fixed width on an element tends to be a bad idea. Instead we can use percentages, which make our lives easier.

The only issue with this is, at large screens, things can get too big. Thankfully, we have max-width that can help us out!

## [Day 4](https://courses.kevinpowell.co/courses/conquering-responsive-layouts/254505-day-4-extra-curricular-activities)
### Extra-curricular
Today is a catch-up day, so no official lessons.

If you are eager to dive keep learning though, there has been some talk about viewport units in the Discord server.

Below is a video where I take a look at them. A word of warning though, I do look at using them for font-size, and while cool, there are some accessibility issues with doing so, so I wouldn't suggest it unless it's just for a personal project of yours.

This is totally optional, and while they can be useful, they will not be something I'll be diving into in this course. If you do like them and want to practice with them, there is no reason you can't incorporate them into future challenges though!

## [Day 5](https://courses.kevinpowell.co/courses/conquering-responsive-layouts/256691-day-5-practice-time)
### Practice time!
You saw what you want to build in the last video. There are no starting files this time, we're writing everything starting at zero! So open up your favorite code editor, or create a new CodePen and start writing some code.

You can find the Figma design file right here if you want to match it as closely as possible.

Also, please feel free to vary it with different fonts or colors if you'd like!

For some of you, this might be simple. For others, if you feel the need to refer back to other lessons, go for it. But no copying and pasting. Write everything from scratch!
